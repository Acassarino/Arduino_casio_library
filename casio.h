/* (C) 2018 by nsg
 * Host implementation for Casio Basic SEND/RECEIVE serial interface operators.
 *
 * Incoming variables (sent by SEND()) are delivered to inboxes,
 * Values for requested variables (requsted by RECEIVE()) are sought in
 * outboxes.
 * Mailboxes have freshness flags (.fresh). They have slightly different
 * meaning for inboxes and for outboxes.
 *
 * Whenever inbox receives a value (sent by a calculator with a SEND()
 * operator), the .fresh flag is set. Firmware should clear this flag after it
 * reads this value and acts on it. Normal inboxes will keep calculator on hold
 * until this flag is cleared. Inbox marked immediate (.immediate flag) do not
 * do this and proceed with the protocol immediately after the value is
 * received.
 * 
 * If a calculator requests a value with a RECEIVE() operator, .immediate
 * outbox will provide a value right away, whether it is fresh or not. Outbox
 * without .immediate flag will keep calculator on hold until .fresh flag goes
 * on. After the value is sent to the calc, the .fresh flag is cleared again.
 * The poll function calls a hook (*cccp_hook_receive) immediately after upon
 * request. The firmware may use it to initiate a process of obtaining a value
 * for that name.
